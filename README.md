# Soil Moisture Detection System
MPLAB project involving a pic16f18877

University of the West Indies, St. Augustine
BSc in Eletrical and Computer Engineering
ECNG 2006 Introduction to Microprocessors

This project involved creating a system that can detect moisture levels categorized as okay,dry,wet with the use of a moisture sensor. 
The thresholds for the dry and wet value are entered using a keypad that accepts inputs from 0 to 1023 as the threshold value is in terms of an ADC value. 
A buzzer sounds a different pattern for each of the moisture levels. A fan turns on if it is wet. Updates would be displayed on a serial monitor like Putty or Termite
using the EUSART component.
